# Ovarian Cancer Survival Analysis

This project explores 5-year survival outcomes for ovarian cancer in the UK, with a focus on rare malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (OGCTs). It combines open NHS Digital datasets with clinical study data to compare national trends with tumour subtype-specific outcomes using both Python and Power BI.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compare national UK ovarian cancer survival trends (NHS Digital)
- Analyse 5-year survival outcomes across OGCT subtypes (from MDPI study)
- Visualise insights using Python and Power BI
- Practice end-to-end data storytelling and dashboarding

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)** – data cleaning & visualisation
- **Power BI** – dashboard design
- **Google Colab** – notebook execution
- **GitHub** – portfolio hosting

## 📊 Key Insights

- NHS national 5-year ovarian cancer survival improved from **58%** (2002–06) to **68%** (2015–19)
- OGCT patients have significantly higher 5-year survival (avg. **84.9%**)
- However, survival varies by tumour subtype:
    - **Dysgerminoma**: 90.9%
    - **Immature Teratoma**: 86.7%
    - **Mixed GCT**: 82.6%
    - **Yolk Sac Tumour**: 79.5%
